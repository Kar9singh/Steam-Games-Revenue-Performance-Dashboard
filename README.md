# Steam-Games-Revenue-Performance-Dashboard

1. Introduction

The global gaming industry has experienced rapid growth over the past decade, driven by digital distribution platforms such as Steam. Steam provides a marketplace where developers publish games and users purchase, download, and review them. Due to the large volume of transactional and user-generated data, analytical dashboards are essential for understanding sales performance, revenue generation, and player engagement.
This Power BI dashboard, titled “Steam Games Revenue & Performance Dashboard”, has been developed to analyze the commercial and performance aspects of games available on Steam. The dashboard focuses on key metrics such as revenue, copies sold, average playtime, pricing, publisher classification, and developer-wise revenue contribution. The objective of this report is to explain the dashboard design, metrics, insights, and its relevance for business and academic analysis.

2. Dataset Overview

The dataset used for this dashboard contains structured information related to Steam games and their performance indicators. Each record in the dataset represents a game or a publisher-level aggregation. The key attributes included are:
•	Game Name – Title of the game available on Steam
•	Price – Selling price of the game
•	Copies Sold – Total number of copies sold
•	Revenue – Total revenue generated by the game
•	Average Playtime – Average time spent by users (in hours)
•	Publisher / Developer – Entity responsible for publishing the game
•	Publisher Class – Classification such as Indie, AA, AAA, or Hobbyist
•	Review Score – User review performance
Before visualization, the dataset was processed to remove inconsistencies, handle missing values, and ensure accurate aggregation of revenue and sales metrics. This ensures that the dashboard insights are reliable and meaningful.

3. Dashboard Design and Canvas Setup

The dashboard is designed using Power BI Desktop with a custom 16:9 canvas layout, which ensures professional presentation and accurate visual measurements. Gridlines and alignment tools were used to maintain consistency across visuals.

Design Features:
•	KPI cards at the top for quick performance overview
•	Charts organized logically for storytelling
•	Consistent color scheme to differentiate metrics
•	Slicers and filters for interactivity
The layout allows users to quickly identify high-level trends while also exploring detailed, game-level insights.

4. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The top section of the dashboard highlights important KPIs that summarize Steam game performance:
•	Average Playtime (18.84K) – Represents average user engagement across games.
•	Copies Sold (212M) – Indicates total units sold, reflecting market reach.
•	Revenue (3.95 Billion) – Shows the total revenue generated by the games in the dataset.
These KPIs provide an immediate snapshot of overall market performance and user engagement on the Steam platform.

5. Revenue Analysis

5.1 Revenue by Developers

The Revenue by Developers visualization displays how revenue is distributed among different developers and publishers. A small number of developers contribute significantly to total revenue, while many others generate relatively smaller amounts.
Insights:
•	Revenue concentration indicates market dominance by a few successful publishers.
•	Indie developers contribute smaller but collectively meaningful revenue.

5.2 Revenue vs Game Price

The Game Price vs Revenue chart examines the relationship between pricing strategy and revenue generation.

Insights:

•	Very low-priced or free games rely on volume rather than price for revenue.
This analysis helps understand effective pricing strategies in the gaming market.

6. Copies Sold Analysis

The Copies Sold (Game-wise) bar chart ranks games based on the number of units sold.
Key Observations:
•	Popular titles such as Banana, Palworld, and Black Myth: Wukong dominate sales.

The Review Score by Publisher Class visual categorizes games into Indie, AA, AAA, and Hobbyist publishers.
Insights:
•	AAA publishers generally maintain higher and more consistent review scores.
•	Indie games show wider variation, indicating innovation as well as risk.
•	Hobbyist publishers contribute minimally to total revenue and reviews.
This analysis highlights how publisher scale impacts quality perception and commercial success.

8. Interactivity and Filters

The dashboard includes interactive slicers and filters that allow users to:
•	Filter data by publisher
•	Analyze specific price ranges
•	Compare games based on copies sold or revenue
All visuals update dynamically based on user selections, enabling customized and detailed analysis without modifying the underlying dataset.

9. Business and Academic Use Cases

This dashboard can be used for:
